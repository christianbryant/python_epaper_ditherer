# Image2Display Software (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

This project is for the software side of development for my custom 7-color E-Paper Display Badge. 

This software is designed to be a user-friendly way for placing images onto the device. 

Future plans to make this dynamic for other users/developers to be able to use for their own E-Paper based projects.

My passion for this project is driven by the lack of Image Dithering applications on the market and I needed a unique way to optimally place images onto my device.
This software follows these set of rules:
```
1. Must be User-Efficient
2. Must be compact
3. Must be Dynamically controlled
4. Must be fully open-source
5. Must be multi-platform
```

## Items Needing to be Completed

* Adjustible display size (For other types of E-Paper Displays)
* Adjustible platte colors (For other types of E-Paper Displays)
* Documentation
* Debug Menu
